# **Data Model** - Optimizing Data for Analytics and Insights

## üìò Overview
The **Data Model** project focuses on transforming raw data ingested into **Delta Lake** into structured, organized datasets that can be easily accessed and analyzed by the **Data Science**, **Data Analyst**, and **Support** teams. The structured data is stored in a **Data Warehouse** to allow fast and efficient data querying, enabling teams to derive insights and create visualizations more effectively.

## üéØ Objective
The goal of this project is to build a **Data Model** that:
- **Data Warehouse**: Organizes the data into a **Data Warehouse**, where different models are stored and structured to facilitate easier querying and faster processing.
- **Optimized for Performance**: Ensures that data is easily accessible for **Data Science**, **Data Analyst**, and **Support** teams, making the querying and reporting process much faster, which is crucial for timely decision-making.

## üîß Technologies Used
- **Azure Databricks**: For processing and transforming data.
- **Delta Lake**: For storing raw and processed data in a scalable and reliable format.
- **SQL Server**: For structured data storage.
- **Azure Data Factory**: For orchestration of the ETL pipeline.
- **Data Warehouse**: Used for storing optimized data models.

## üõ†Ô∏è Process

1. **Data Ingestion and Storage**:
   - Raw data from various sources, such as **SQL Server**, **MongoDB**, **Azure Storage Tables**, and **APIs**, are ingested into **Delta Lake**.
   - **Delta Lake** ensures that the data is stored in a fault-tolerant and scalable format, making it reliable for further transformations.

2. **Data Warehouse Design**:
   - A **Data Warehouse** is structured to optimize query performance. Data is organized into **Data Models** that support the needs of different teams (Data Science, Data Analyst, and Support).
   - The warehouse is designed to facilitate faster and more efficient querying, enabling quick access to high-quality data for further analysis.
   - Multiple **Data Models** are created to reflect key business entities, such as customer profiles, transactions, product information, and campaign results.

3. **Optimizing for Analytics**:
   - The structured data in the **Data Warehouse** is optimized for use in **Data Science** and **Data Analytics** projects.
   - It ensures that teams can easily access data for running machine learning models, generating reports, and visualizing trends or patterns.

4. **Performance and Scalability**:
   - By storing the data in a structured **Data Warehouse**, the system can handle large volumes of data and scale as the organization grows.
   - Data models are optimized for faster querying, reducing the time taken to generate reports or analyze trends.
   - **Indexing** and **partitioning** strategies are applied to enhance query performance and minimize data retrieval times.

5. **Support for Downstream Use**:
   - The **Data Warehouse** makes it easier for **Support teams** to pull data for customer service, billing inquiries, and troubleshooting.
   - The data is structured to ensure that it is easy to access without having to go through raw data, saving time and effort.
