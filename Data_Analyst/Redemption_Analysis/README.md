  This dashboard serves as a prototype for visualizing Redemption Analysis data. Based on the current design and objectives, the dashboard will be divided into two main sections:
  1. **Overview Section**
  This section provides a high-level summary of redemption activities to help users understand the overall performance at a glance. Key insights in this section include:

- Total Users: The total number of users eligible for redemption.
- Total User Redemption: The count of unique users who have redeemed rewards.
- Total Redemption: The total number of redemption transactions.
- Redemption Trends (Daily/Monthly): Graphs or trends showing redemption patterns over time to identify activity spikes or downtimes.
- Redemption Rate: The percentage of users who engaged in redemption activities out of the total eligible users.
- Top Campaigns: Highlights the most successful campaigns with the highest number of redemptions.
-   ### This section answers questions such as:

- How many users are actively redeeming rewards?
- Are there noticeable trends or seasonal patterns in redemptions?
- Which campaigns are performing best?
  

**2. Redemption Detail Section**
 This section focuses on breaking down the redemption data into more granular insights. It allows further exploration of:

- Campaign-Specific Redemptions: A breakdown of how many redemptions occurred per campaign, identifying which campaigns are underperforming or exceeding expectations.
- Popular Rewards: Insights into which rewards/items customers are redeeming most frequently.
- User-Level Details: A drill-down into individual user activity, such as:
- Who is redeeming?
- What items or rewards they are redeeming?
- Their engagement with specific campaigns.
- ###This section helps answer:

- What are the most redeemed rewards or campaigns?
- Who are the key customer segments driving redemptions?
