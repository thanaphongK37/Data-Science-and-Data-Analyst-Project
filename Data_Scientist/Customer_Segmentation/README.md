Customer Segmentation
üìò Overview
The Customer Segmentation project is aimed at dividing a company's customer base into distinct segments based on similar characteristics. This segmentation can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies, products, and services to better serve each group of customers.

üéØ Objective
The objective of this project is to use machine learning techniques to segment customers based on various attributes such as purchasing behavior, demographics, and other relevant features. This segmentation can provide actionable insights that help businesses improve customer retention, increase sales, and optimize marketing efforts.

üßë‚Äçüíª Approach
Data Collection:

Data was collected from customer transactions and demographic information.
The dataset includes features such as age, purchase history
Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Outlier detection and removal to ensure data quality.
Feature Selection
Analyzing the distribution of each feature and performing outlier removal.
Clustering Algorithms
Using KBinsDiscretizer to discretize data into four groups.
Applying K-Means Clustering to group customers based on their similarities.
Result Analysis
Using t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to reduce data dimensionality to two dimensions. This allows for better visualization of the data distribution.
Evaluating the best clustering technique using metrics such as the Silhouette Score and Elbow Method.
Using MLflow to track experiments and save model versions.
The resulting customer segments will be analyzed to gain insights into unique behaviors within each group. These insights can be used to enhance personalized marketing, sales strategies, and customer service improvements.

üîß Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and result analysis.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms, including K-Means, KBinsDiscretizer, and t-SNE.
MLflow: For experiment tracking and model version control.
