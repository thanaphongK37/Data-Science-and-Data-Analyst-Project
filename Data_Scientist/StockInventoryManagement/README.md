## ðŸ“˜ Overview
The Stock Inventory Management Report was created to optimize and streamline the process of monitoring and controlling stock purchasing. This tool addresses key challenges in inventory management by consolidating data into a single, easy-to-use report.

## ðŸŽ¯ ObjectiveObjective
The Inventory Management Report was developed to monitor and control stock purchasing processes effectively.

## Background Problem
**Previously, stock management faced several issues:**

1. **Manual Management:** Stock orders were managed manually by multiple individuals, increasing the likelihood of errors.
2. **Scattered Data Sources:** Information required for stock decisions was spread across various platforms, forcing users to compile data manually.
3. **Impact on Inventory Levels:**
    - Overstocking or unsold inventory occurred for some SKUs.
    - Insufficient stock for other SKUs led to missed sales opportunities.
##Purpose

**This report is designed to:**

1.** Reduce Manual Work:** Consolidate all necessary data into a single report, minimizing human error and effort.
2. **Improve Efficiency**: Reduce the time spent on verifying and compiling data for purchasing decisions.
3. **Enhance Visibility:** Provide better insight into stock levels to avoid overstocking or understocking issues.

## Currently: Manual Monitoring Tool
In the first phase, the report serves as a manual monitoring tool to assist users in making better-informed decisions regarding stock purchasing. Future iterations aim to introduce automation to replace manual processes, further enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

## Next Step 
Automation with AI & ML
In future phases, Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be integrated into the system to

These enhancements will transition the report from a manual monitoring tool to a fully automated inventory management system.
