# **Recommendation System**

## üìò Overview  
The **Recommendation System** project focuses on building a recommendation engine that suggests relevant products or services to users based on text-based similarity and classification models.  

## üéØ Objective  
The goal of this project is to develop a recommendation system using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** and **machine learning models** to provide personalized suggestions.  

## üßë‚Äçüíª Approach  

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Used **word_tokenize** from `pythainlp` to tokenize and clean text data for better matching of words.  

### **Feature Selection**  
- Used **TF-IDF Vectorizer** (`TfidfVectorizer`) to transform text into numerical feature vectors.  
- Applied **cosine similarity** and **linear kernel** to measure the similarity between different text inputs.  

### **Model Training & Prediction**  
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** and **Gradient Boosted Trees (GBTClassifier)** for classification tasks.  
- Tracked experiments using **MLflow**.  
- Evaluated model performance using **MulticlassClassificationEvaluator**.
