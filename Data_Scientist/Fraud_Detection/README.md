# **Fraud Detection**

## üìò Overview  
This **Fraud Detection** project is developed in collaboration with the **Data Scientist Team Lead**. The goal is to build fraud detection mechanisms by analyzing identity patterns and transaction behaviors, focusing on **Identity Fullname Verification** and **Redeem Scoring** metrics.  

## üéØ Objective  
The primary objectives of this project are:  
1. **Identity Fullname Verification**: Detect potential fraudulent identities by analyzing name structures.  
2. **Redeem Scoring**: Evaluate and score redemption behavior to identify suspicious activities.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Approach  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Identity Fullname Verification**  
- Explored multiple techniques for **language detection**, **phonetic similarity**, and **named entity recognition (NER)**.  
- Tested different models such as:  
  - **Rule-based methods** using `pythainlp` for tokenization, soundex (`lk82`), pronunciation analysis, and spell checking.  
  - **Machine learning models** like `RandomForestClassifier` and `LogisticRegression`.  
  - **Deep learning models** such as `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModelForTokenClassification` from `transformers`, which yielded the best performance.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Redeem Scoring (RDM)**
Developed **multiple scoring metrics** to evaluate customer redemption behavior:  

#### **üìå Redeem Timing (RDM_Timing)**  
- **Published Date - Redeem Date (RDM_TimingPublished)**: Measures the time gap between coupon publication and redemption.  
- **Closest Redeem (RDM_TimingCloset)**: Detects if a user redeems multiple coupons in quick succession.  
- **Latest Redeem (Recency) (RDM_TimingLatest)**: Tracks the most recent redemption activity.  

#### **üìå Redeem Distribution (RDM_Distribution)**  
- **By Campaign Type (RDM_DistributionByCampaignType)**: Analyzes redemption trends across different campaign types.  
- **By Period (Time/Hr) (RDM_DistributionPeriod)**: Identifies peak redemption times.  

#### **üìå Redeem Frequency (RDM_Frequency)**  
- **By Period (Days) (RDM_FrequencyByDays)**: Evaluates how frequently a user redeems over time.  
- **By Times (Times) (RDM_FrequencyByTimes)**: Measures total redemption count per user.  

**üìä Current Status**  
- **Identity Fullname Verification**: Model trained and evaluated.  
- **Redeem Scoring**: Metrics are being monitored via dashboards. Model training is yet to begin.
